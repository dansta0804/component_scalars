## About the component
The `vdot` component is an educational tool for upper secondary school (11-12) students who want to better understand the concept of vector scalar product and improve their Python programming language skills by developing programs that integrate the developed component.

---

## ‚ú® Features
The Python component processes text files containing vectors, computes scalar products and displays the results in a specified format.

#### Input
The component is able to process input files containing:
- Comment lines (they do not contain vector values). These lines start symbol `#`;
- Empty lines;
- Vector values that are provided in a scientific notation (for example, `-5.125e19`);
- Lines with non-numeric vector values (for example, `6d`);
- Odd number of vector values in a line (in such case scalar product cannot be computed).

#### Result
The result (the scalar product) is represented using the default format `5.6g`, which indicates that small numbers are represented using a low decimal expression, very large or very small values are represented using an exponential format (scientific notation).

## üìù Methods
| Method name   | Description    | Parameters    | Output    |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| ``calculate_dot_product (output, str vectors, str filename, frmt)``  | Calculates the dot product of two vectors in a string. | ``vectors:`` a string with vector elements separated by space; ``filename:`` - name of the file (used for error messages); ``frmt`` - output format string (e.g., '5.6g'). | Dot product as float or None if error.|
| ``handle_input (output, files, frmt)``  | Processes input files and computes dot products from each line. | ``files:`` - a list of input file paths; ``frmt`` - output format string (e.g., '5.6g'). | Nothing. Prints results to stdout.|

## ‚ùì Usage
The installed component can be used in multiple ways, where different `vdot` program usages are described below. Input files that are used to explain program usage are available in directory `Inputs`:
**1. One input file**.
The program reads one provided file that contains vector values.

***Program call:***
```
vdot ./Inputs/even_nnum.dat
```

***Expected result:***
```

```

**2. Multiple input files**.
The program reads multiple provided files that contain vector values.

***Program call:***
```
vdot ./Inputs/even_nnum.dat ./Inputs/odd_num.dat [file3 file4 ...]
```

***Expected result:***
```
Processing ./Inputs/even_nnum.dat...

Result (dot product):   177

# 2 vector pair(-s) was(were) multiplied in total.
```


**3. One or more input files and '-f'**.
The program reads one or more provided files that contain vector values and displays the formatted scalar product (`-f` is used to specify the format; allowed formats: `5.6g`, `3.3e`, `4.4f`):


***Program calls:***
```
vdot ./Inputs/even_nnum.dat -f 3.3e
```

```
vdot ./Inputs/even_nnum.dat ./Inputs/odd_num.dat -f 3.3e
```

***Expected result (the first example):***
```
Processing ./Inputs/even_nnum.dat...
Working with vectors: 5 6a 8 9              2.3 4.05 6.001 1.5
